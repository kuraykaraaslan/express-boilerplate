# Security Policy

This project follows strict security standards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems and user data.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Practices

### 1. Input Validation
- All incoming request payloads are validated using **Zod schema validation**.
- Prevents common attacks like SQL Injection and malicious payloads.

### 2. Authentication
- Uses **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for stateless authentication.
- Access tokens include expiration (`exp`) and are securely signed.
- **Token Refresh** and **Logout/Revocation** mechanisms are supported.

### 3. Authorization (RBAC)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is implemented at **operation** and **field level**.
- Modular permission services are defined for each model (e.g., `User`, `Tenant`).
- Admin users are granted full access while other roles are restricted based on context.

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Rate limiting is enforced using **Redis-backed mechanisms**.
- Protection against brute-force, abuse, and DDoS attacks.
- Supports per-user and per-IP limiting strategies.

### 5. HTTP Security Headers
- All routes are protected with **Helmet** middleware.
- Prevents clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.

### 6. CORS
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is restricted with **explicit origin whitelisting**.
- Wildcard origins (`*`) are not used in production.

### 7. Centralized Error Handling
- All errors are caught and processed through a global middleware.
- Distinguishes between operational errors and unexpected system errors.
- Custom `AppError` class used to wrap known errors with proper status codes.

### 8. Logging
- Errors, warnings, and system activity are logged using a centralized `Logger`.
- Logs are structured and support both console and file-based outputs.

### 9. Audit Trail
- User actions (e.g., CRUD operations) are recorded for traceability.
- Each permission decision is logged, including denials.
